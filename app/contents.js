inspired by Olivia Jack's Hydra live coding environment. Each sketch
is a code snippet representing the number in a geometric form, loaded
in a random sequence. The code fills, alters and paints the grid of
pixels, creating different patterns depending upon the order of
sketches.<br>

#spektrum is a convolution of identity questions that we face, including, but not only, the gender spectrum and autism spectrum. The fingers as an analog, imperfect medium with a color spectrum of nail polish count binary numbers mimicking a self-stimulatory behavior (stimming) to provoke and to challenge the stereotype of "binariness" of autism.<br>

      Tech is Nonbinary is an audiovisual dance performance. Starting from a blank editor, graphics and sound are coded in real-time by live-coding environments, with expressions of body movements. The artist questions the classical way of rigid frameworks and productive scheme through an ephemeral and experimental nature of live coding. As images are generated by computer programs, the video may include flickering by accident.

      Distant Movements is a project by Annie Abrahams (FR/NL), Daniel Pinheiro
      (PT) and Muriel Piqué (FR). They develop an experimental, performative
      approach to examine what «dancing together» could mean in an environment
      where bodies are entangled with machines. Questions like: “Under what
      conditions can we dance together online?, “How will a dance practice in an
      artificial environment differ from a «normal» dance practice?”, “Can the
      emergence of dance in bodies that are both distant and together become
      visible and if so how?”, guide the project, which is also a concrete
      example of a remotely activated multilingual collaborative artistic
      research. DM comes to NODE20 as a one-off welcoming everyone.<br />

      We participated in Tidal Club’s New Moon Marathon livestreaming, as a collective “vc-study” performing live-coded sound with TidalCycles. The event is a 24-hour non-stop livestreaming with 72 performance of 20 minute each. vc-study is an informal collective of Japanese artists and programmers learning or studying different creative-code related tools from scratch every week. One of the members, @FMS_Cat created tidal-bot that runs on Discord, interprets TidalCycles code mentioned on the chat and outputs sound on the voice chat. It is a neat implementation as many people can join and perform together, a similar goal as estuary but with a different approach.

      Quarantine time confines a body in a limited space surrounded by flat
      walls and urges us to have a fixed routine at home that ends up in
      flatness of time. The physical world becomes stiff and tasteless.
      Meanwhile, in a digital space, time is not linear as there is no constant
      rhythm - by interrupting and confusing the network, the accelerated
      miscommunication can lead us to another channel of communication.

Algorithm | Degeneracy is a hybrid live-code-dance performance that travels between modalities such as images, emotions as words, sounds and movements through a perspective of high-functioning autism. Naoto Hieda, as a dancer and a live-coder, picks a word from a vocabulary of emotions and records movements overlaid on an image found on Google search. A chat interface is used to communicate with the audience; furthermore, each byte of an input text is translated into sound in a live-coding manner, adding another modality to express emotions. The performance takes place as a live-streaming and as an online installation in a custom virtual space where visitors can freely navigate. The online platform resembles a white gallery space, and the artifacts of the performance are installed on the fly. Contrary to the ephemerality of the performance, the recorded movements and sounds remain as a permanent exhibition.

      Before media art has emerged, traditional art and dance are already applying algorithms to make sophisticated patterns in their textures or movements. Hieda is researching the use of algorithm through creation of media installations and dialog with artists, dancers, choreographers and musicians. He also presents his current interest in machine learning and art which potentially exclude (or already excluding) some populations due to the dataset and modality.

    "Stäbetanz" is originally a choreography by Oskar Schlemmer. It is part of the Bauhaus dances. In honor of 100 years anniversary of Bauhaus we created a 21st century version of the "Stäbetanz". This time the poles (Stäbe) are created by a motiontracking system created by Naoto Hieda. The residency programm which made this possible is supported by the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts and the Goethe Institut.<br>
